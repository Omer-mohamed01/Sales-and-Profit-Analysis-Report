1. The Profitability "Leaky Bucket"
1-Which products are losing us money? Identify the sub-categories where the average profit margin is negative.
2-Is our discount strategy failing? Find the specific threshold (e.g., is it 20%? 40%?)
where discounts stop driving volume and start destroying profit.
3-Are certain regions "expensive" to serve? Compare profit margins across different States and Cities
to see if shipping or local costs are eating our returns.

2. Operational Efficiency
1-Are we meeting our shipping promises? Calculate the average Ship Days vs. Shipping Speed
to see if "Standard Class" is actually meeting its targets.
2-Where are the shipping bottlenecks? Which Regions or States have the longest delay
between the Order Date and the Ship Date?
3-Does shipping delay impact future sales? Analyze if customers who experience higher Ship Days
are less likely to place a second order.

3. Customer & Product Strategy
1-Who are our most valuable customers? Beyond just total sales, which customers have the highest
lifetime profit margin?
2-Which product categories are "Volume Drivers" vs. "Profit Drivers"? For example, does Technology bring in
the most cash while Office Supplies bring in the most consistent profit?
4-Is there a "Basket Analysis" opportunity? Do customers who buy "Furniture" (like the bookcase in your data)
typically buy specific "Office Supplies" in the same order?

4. Growth & Seasonality
1-What is our "Peak" season performance? Using the Month and Quarter columns, identify exactly
when the workload spikes and if profit margins hold steady during those busy times.
2-Which segments are growing? Compare Year-over-Year (YoY) performance for the "Consumer" vs. "Corporate" segments.
